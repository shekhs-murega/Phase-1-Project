# Phase-1-Project
You can have some fun and learn interesting dog facts. The website provides random dog facts. It's a fun and engaging experience.

# Dog Breed Viewer and Comment Section

A web application that allows you to view information about various dog breeds and participate in discussions by adding, editing, and deleting comments. It's basically a learning application for a selected range of dogbreeds.
I fetched data from the following dog API:

```bash
https://dogapi.dog/docs/api-v2
```
